## p5js_lfpr
This example provides an example of a nice fluid animation. It draws on the data from [No Ceilings](http://noceilings.org), available at [https://github.com/fathominfo/noceilings-data](https://github.com/fathominfo/noceilings-data). This particular indicator describes the Labor Force Participation Rate for each country, comparing what percentage of the population is employed for men and women. 

The code demonstrates how to load and reference JSON data in p5js, and some of the cleanup required to bring together multiple datasets. In addition to hovering the visualization, this example shows how to use the p5js dom library to create buttons, and how make code execute when a button is clicked. It also provides examples of how to sort the same data in different ways, and to animate the data as it transitions between different states.
