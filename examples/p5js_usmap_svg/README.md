## p5js_usmap_svg
In the web world, a convenient way to draw shapes in a map is by using Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) files. SVGâ€™s are images which can be searched, indexed and scaled to different sized without looking pixelated. This is a very different type of image from what p5.js typically does. Instead of drawing and refreshing a canvas, you can add an svg element to your web page, much like a &lt;div&gt; or a &lt;p&gt; tag. Setting its color is a lot like setting the text of a paragraph, but it's just different enough that it bypasses a lot of what makes p5.js great. 

This example demonstrates the basics of loading an SVG into p5.js, and how to build a simple interaction by clicking a state.
