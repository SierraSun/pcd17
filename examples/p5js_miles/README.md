# p5js_miles
If you are new to processing or p5.js, this example is a good place to start. We show five iterations of the same sketch, adding a basic mouse interaction and refining as we go. The source data is based on the recording career of Miles Davis, and the sketches build up to something akin to ["Scaled in Miles"](https://fathom.info/miles-web/). 
1. [mvp_01](examples/mvp_01/) starts with the basics of loading a json file, and lays out a fixed timeline of recording sessions
2. [mvp_02](examples/mvp_02/) adds a little interactivity, showing the place and date of whichever recording session the mouse is over currently. 
3. [mvp_03](examples/mvp_03/) adds the list of musicians for each recording session
4. [mvp_04](examples/mvp_04/) adds an indicator for each musician in the current session to show how oftern they recorded with Miles. 
5. [mvp_05](examples/mvp_05/) improves just a little on mvp_04 by sorting the musicians who played on the date.
