# processing_quakes_pdf
This sketch demonstrates a couple highlights of desktop Processing. Web pages are great for making a visualization available to alot of people, but it can be a challenge to work with large datasets. And if you are working with print, then the web code can be a detour. 

This sketch loads a data file that is larger than what you typically want to load over the web, and then saves it as a PDF after itâ€™s drawn.
