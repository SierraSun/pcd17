# processing_quakes_pdf
This sketch demonstrates a couple highlights of desktop Processing. Web pages are great for making a visualization available to a lot of people, but it can be a challenge to work with large datasets. And if you are working with print, then coding for the web can be a detour. SO this sketch uses desktop processing. It loads a data file that is larger than what you typically want to load over the web, and then saves it as a PDF after itâ€™s drawn.
