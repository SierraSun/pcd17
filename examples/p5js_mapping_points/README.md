# p5js_mapping_points
This example uses zip code data to show how to draw map coordinates on the canvas. The code includes functions that take the latitude and longitude points and calculates the specific location based on different projections (Albers is shown, but Mercator is included in the code as well). After the locations have been calculated, points are drawn based on their x and y positions in the projection.
